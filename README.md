# Susan's Cookbook

This project was created for my sister (who is a fabulous cook). 
It uses the MERN stack and is hosted using Netlify for the front end and AWS Lightsail for the server. It can be accessed here: https://susanscookbook.netlify.app 

All users are welcome to browse her delicious recipes, but the grocery feature, along with editing and deleting recipes are restricted to those with an account.
